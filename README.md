# NETCHECK
Simple network checker that I made using the requests module in Python 3.

## Installation
You'll need these modules in order to make it working:
```
- requests
- colorama
```

Then you can download the script and run it without problems, I hope :(

Or better, download the executables from the [release](https://github.com/AleK3y/netcheck/releases), which are standalone.
